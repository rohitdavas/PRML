<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Inspired from the opensource implementation ( [github](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction) ) of 
Reinforcement Learning-An introduction,a well known book by Rich Sutton and Andrew Barto, I started the figure wise implementation of PRML - Patten recognition and Machine Learning. 

There are several implementations of the book already implemented by the great community ( see reference section ), however none of them uses the figure-wise approach in my knowledge.

The aim of the projects are 
- chapter wise and figure wise implementation of the PRML book.
- All figures have  standalone implementation, requiring as fewer libraries and inter dependencies as possible.
